"""EntailmentBank explanatory-sentence dataset for VAE training.

Follows the LangVAE paper (arXiv:2505.00004): the sentence VAE is trained to
reconstruct individual *explanatory sentences* from EntailmentBank (the
entailment-tree facts and intermediate conclusions), one sentence per example,
deduplicated. There is no notion of an unanswerable / NULL example here, so
``is_answerable`` is always True and the null-handling machinery
(``null_loss_weight``, balanced sampler) is a no-op for this corpus.

Source: the ``nguyen-brat/entailment_bank`` HF mirror, whose ``cot`` field holds
the chain-of-thought explanatory sentences. We flatten ``cot`` across all rows
into a single deduplicated sentence pool, matching the paper's "subset of all
explanatory sentences" preprocessing.
